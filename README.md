# MAE290B_WI22_Project_DZ
Final Project Codes and Reports for MAE290B (UCSD Winter 2022)

Code written as part of the final project for MAE 290B: Numerical Methods for Differential Equations, taken at UC San Diego in Winder 2022. The Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method was implemented to solve an unsteady, nonhomogeneous reaction-diffusion equation with zero Dirichlet boundary condition on a 2D rectangular domain. The source strength and initial condition are provided.
