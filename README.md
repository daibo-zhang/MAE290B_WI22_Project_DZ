Final Project Codes and Reports for MAE290B (UCSD Winter 2022)

Code written as part of the final project for MAE 290B: Numerical Methods for Differential Equations, taken at UC San Diego in Winder 2022. The course is taught by Prof. Sutanu Sarkar. The Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method was implemented to solve an unsteady, nonhomogeneous reaction-diffusion equation with zero Dirichlet boundary condition on a 2D rectangular domain. The source strength and initial condition are provided. 

For details of the problem, the method, and the results, please refer to the project report. The project follows a provided outline, which is the intellectual property of Prof. Sarkar.
